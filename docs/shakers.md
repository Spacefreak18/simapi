# Bass Shakers

Bass Shakers are special sound transducers, monocoque uses game telemetry to generate sound pulses for specific events such as engine rpm, gears, and tyre slip. The shakers are setup much like normal speakrs.

The key to a great experience is to remember that less is more. Not too many shakers, and not too many events should be sent to a single shaker.

The monocoque configuration for shakers looks like this:

```
{
device       = "Sound";
effect       = "Engine";
devid        = "alsa_output.usb-Generic_USB2.0_Device_20170726905959-00.analog-stereo";
channels     = 2;
pan          = 0;
tyre         = "FrontLeft";
volume       = 90;
modulation   = "frequency"; // or "amplify"
frequency    = 27;
frequencyMax = 37;
amplitude    = 50;
amplitudeMax = 100;
}
```

+ modulation - can be frequency ( higher effect levels result in a higher frequency ) or amplify ( higher effect level result in higher volume)
+ frequency - base frequency of effect ( needed regardless of modulation type selected )
+ amplitude - base amplitude of effect ( needed regardless of modulation type selected but will default to 100 if not specified ) ( 25 or 50 are good values if you're using amplitude modulation)
+ frequencyMax - max frequency of effect, which only applies if modulation = frequency
+ channels - number of channels, stereo cards would be 2, a 7.1 card would be 8
+ pan - left, right, subwoofer but the actual id which can be anywhere from 0-8 ( surround sound cards are supported, but it can be a challenge to map physical channels to the correct channel id )
+ effect - engine, gear, tyrelock, tyreslip, abs, suspension
+ devid - find with ```pacmd list-sinks | grep name:```
+ tyre - All, Fronts, Rears, FrontLeft, RearRight, etc when applicable to the effect
+ volume - volume of effect at sound device level ( amplitude is the volume being generated by the software itself )

Setting up bass shakers and getting a good experience is a bit of a black art. Here are some tips ( mostly pertaining to SimHub ) but deal with the fine tuning and would still apply.
